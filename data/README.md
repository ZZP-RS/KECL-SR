## Datasets

We provide two preprocessed datasets, ml-1m and ml-10m.

### File Format:  '.npz'

The '.npz' files are used to store item embedding matrices generated from TransR training, they are item embedding matrix, which is a result of training using the TransR model. The indices in the embedding matrix correspond directly to item IDs. This means that each row in the matrix is an embedding that represents a specific item, and the index of that row matches the item's unique ID.
